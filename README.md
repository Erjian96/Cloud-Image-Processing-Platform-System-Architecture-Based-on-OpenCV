# Cloud-Image-Processing-Platform-System-Architecture-Based-on-OpenCV
Used python to code the client and server side of the software on Visual Studio by combining the database SQLite3.
Collected images from cameras or abstracted local files and realized images processing by operation orders to the server through socket transmission and corresponding functions from OpenCV
Called the OpenCV to process image effects to achieve color to black and white, edge detection and face recognition, and can use the database to inquire, increase or decrease users.
Honed development techniques in C/S construction and exercised the server construction and programming methods.
